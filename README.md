- Conducted a comprehensive analysis comparing various implementations of the Fibonacci sequence in both Python and C.
- Implemented multiple algorithms, including **recursive**, **iterative**, and **dynamic programming** approaches, to assess performance and efficiency.
- Utilized **Python** for high-level implementation and data visualization, and **C** for low-level performance-critical comparisons.
- Generated detailed performance metrics and visualizations, including execution time comparisons and recursion tree analysis.
- Authored a robust set of test cases and automated testing scripts to ensure accuracy and reliability of the implementations.
